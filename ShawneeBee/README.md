# HTML-And-Grid-Layout
Create a responsive HTML grid layout that is usable across all device viewport sizes including phone, tablet, and desktop. 

You may utilize grid systems such as Bootstrap or create your own.  Make sure that the CSS media queries you use correctly target the viewports and that your styles render as expected.  In addition, make sure to include at least a logo image into your interface and include the correct ARIA attribute for this image(s).
